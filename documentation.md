## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

CubedPandas provides an easy, intuitive, fast and fun approach to perform multi-dimensional 
data analysis & processing on Pandas dataframes. CubedPandas wraps almost any
dataframe into a multi-dimensional data cube, which can be aggregated, sliced, diced, filtered, 
updated and much more. 
CubedPandas is inspired by OLAP cubes (online analytical processing), which are typically used
for reporting, business intelligence, data warehousing and financial analysis purposes.
