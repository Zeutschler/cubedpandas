# Backlog 
Missing and pending features to be implemented:

### Errors
- cube[("A", "B"),] works, but cube[("A", "B")] does not work. But it should work.
  Solution: check if member are all from same dimension and forward them as a tuple...

### Cube
- info() method to get information about the cube
- filters on members, e.g.: quantity > 10

### Dimenions
- *none*

### Cell access
- more complex filters on members, e.g.: quantity > 10 

### Other... 
- support for (simple) MDX queries
